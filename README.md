A hands-on elective course that teaches how to build and operate reliable systems using Site Reliability Engineering practices. You work on a provided microservice application (**QuickTicket**) and progressively add observability, SLOs, CI/CD, GitOps, progressive delivery, chaos experiments, and database resilience — ending with an interview-ready portfolio project.

> *"Hope is not a strategy."* — Google SRE motto

## The Project: QuickTicket

A 3-service ticket reservation system. **You don't build the app; you make it reliable.** (Lab 11 adds a 4th service as an exercise in the bonus track.)

| Service | Role | State | Language |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **gateway** | API router, timeouts, Lab 11 resilience patterns | Stateless | Python 3.13 / FastAPI |
| **events** | Tickets, reservations, orders | PostgreSQL + Redis | Python 3.13 / FastAPI |
| **payments** | Mock payment processor, tunable failures | Stateless | Python 3.13 / FastAPI |
| **notifications** | Mock notifier (Lab 11) | Stateless | Python 3.13 / FastAPI |

All services expose Prometheus metrics (`*_requests_total`, `*_request_duration_seconds`) and emit structured JSON logs.

**Built-in fault injection** via environment variables — no extra tools needed for chaos:

| Variable | Service | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `PAYMENT_FAILURE_RATE=0.3` | payments | 30% of charges return 500 |
| `PAYMENT_LATENCY_MS=2000` | payments | Every charge takes 2s+ |
| `NOTIFY_FAILURE_RATE=0.5` | notifications *(Lab 11)* | Half of notifies return 500 |
| `NOTIFY_LATENCY_MS=300` | notifications *(Lab 11)* | Injected notify latency |
| `DB_MAX_CONNS=3` | events | Tiny connection pool, exhausts under load |
| `GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS=3000` | gateway | Gateway gives up after 3s |

## Lectures

Each lecture is 17-25 slides, 340-520 lines of Markdown. Readings 11-12 are self-study (no slide format, pure prose: 400-500 lines each).

## Technology Stack

All tools are **free and open-source** (or have a free tier). Versions are pinned to the latest stable as of April 2026.

| Category | Tool | Version | Introduced |
|----------|------|---------|------------|
| Application runtime | Python + FastAPI + uvicorn | 3.13 / 0.136 / 0.44 | Week 1 (provided) |
| Containers | Docker + Compose | Docker 28.x | Week 1 |
| Database | PostgreSQL | 17-alpine | Week 1 (provided) |
| Cache / KV | Redis | 7-alpine | Week 1 (provided) |
| Metrics | Prometheus | v3.11.2 | Week 3 (docker-compose); Week 7 (in-cluster) |
| Dashboards | Grafana | 13.0.1 | Week 3 |
| Kubernetes | k3d (k3s in Docker) | v1.33 | Week 4 |
| Packaging *(optional)* | Helm 3 | — | Week 4 (bonus only) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + ghcr.io | — | Week 5 |
| GitOps | ArgoCD | v3.3.x | Week 5 |
| Alerting | Grafana Alerting | — | Week 6 |
| Progressive Delivery | Argo Rollouts | v1.9.x | Week 7 |
| DB Migrations | Alembic | 1.18 | Week 9 |
| Load Testing | Locust | 2.43 | Week 10 |

**Kubernetes is introduced in Week 4 and used for every subsequent lab** — labs do not ship docker-compose-based alternatives after that point.

> 📡 **On "observability stack" scope:** the course uses Prometheus + Grafana only. Tempo/Loki are *mentioned* in lectures as adjacent tooling you'd add in a production stack, but aren't deployed. Services expose plain Prometheus metrics (no OpenTelemetry SDK).

## What Ships vs What Students Produce

The course repo ships **only** lab specs, lecture notes, and the application. Students generate the infra layer per lab in their own fork:

| Path | Ships in repo | Students produce |
|------|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| `app/` (gateway, events, payments, seed.sql, loadgen/) | ✅ | |
| `lectures/` | ✅ | |
| `labs/labN.md` | ✅ | |
| `labs/labN/*.yaml`, `labs/lab10/locustfile.py` — *plumbing* for labs that needs a file | ✅ | |
| `monitoring/grafana/` (provisioning + golden-signals dashboard skeleton) | ✅ | |
| `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` — *students write in Lab 3* | | ✅ |
| `k8s/*.yaml` — *students write in Lab 4, evolve through Lab 12* | | ✅ |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — *students add in Lab 5* | | ✅ |
| `migrations/` + `alembic.ini` — *`alembic init` in Lab 9* | | ✅ |
| `app/notifications/` — *students add in Lab 11 (bonus)* | | ✅ |
| `locustfile.py` at repo root — *copied from `labs/lab10/` in Lab 10* | | ✅ |
| `submissions/` — *lab reports, one per week* | | ✅ |

The [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) enforces the split so student artifacts don't accidentally get pushed to the course repo.

**Provided lab-asset files** (plumbing — not the lab's learning objective):

| File | Purpose | Used in |
|------|---------|---------|
| [`labs/lab7/prometheus.yaml`](labs/lab7/prometheus.yaml) | In-cluster Prometheus with pod-SD + `rollouts-pod-template-hash → rs_hash` relabel | Lab 7 Bonus, 8, 10, 12 |
| [`labs/lab7/analysis-template.yaml`](labs/lab7/analysis-template.yaml) | AnalysisTemplate with `initialDelay` + safe numerator fallback for canary error-rate | Lab 7 Bonus |
| [`labs/lab7/loadgen.yaml`](labs/lab7/loadgen.yaml) | In-cluster curl loop hitting `/events` + `/health` | Lab 7 |
| [`labs/lab8/mixedload.yaml`](labs/lab8/mixedload.yaml) | In-cluster curl loop hitting the full checkout chain | Labs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |
| [`labs/lab9/backup-storage.yaml`](labs/lab9/backup-storage.yaml) | PVC + `backup-inspector` Deployment for DB backups | Lab 9 Bonus |
| [`labs/lab10/locustfile.py`](labs/lab10/locustfile.py) | Locust scenario (list/reserve/health mix, spread across events 3+5) | Lab 10 |
| [`labs/lab10/locust-runner.yaml`](labs/lab10/locust-runner.yaml) | Job template for running Locust in-cluster | Lab 10 |

## Lab Structure

Each lab in weeks 1-10 caps at **12 pts = 10 main + 2 bonus**.

| Task | Points | Description | Required? |
|------|-------:|-------------|-----------|
| **Task 1** | 6 pts | Core step that advances the project. Future labs depend on it. | Yes |
| **Task 2** | 4 pts (3 in Lab 1) | Deeper dive into the week's topic. Skippable — won't affect future labs. | No |
| **Task 3** | 1 pt | *Lab 1 only* — GitHub community engagement. | Lab 1 |
| **Bonus Task** | 2 pts | Extension for motivated students (flat 2 pts each, no difficulty weighting). | No |

A student who only completes **Task 1 across all 10 labs** still ends up with a fully working SRE portfolio project.

**Bonus labs (11 + 12)** have a tighter shape: **Task 1 (4 pts) + Task 2 (4 pts) + Bonus Task (2 pts) = 10 pts total** (vs main labs' 12). The labs are bonus-track in the sense that they're not on the critical path; the Bonus Task inside each lab is still the genuinely-challenging extension. Bonus labs count toward a separate 20% weight (see grading below).

### Submission Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Fork Repo"] --> B["Create Branch<br/>feature/labN"]
    B --> C["Complete Tasks"]
    C --> D["Write<br/>submissions/labN.md"]
    D --> E["Push & Open PR"]
    E --> F["Submit PR URL<br/>via Moodle"]
    F --> G["Receive Feedback"]

    style A fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style E fill:#F44336,color:#fff
    style F fill:#00BCD4,color:#fff
```

Submissions are **CLI output + brief analysis**, not source code. Paste the commands you ran and what they printed; answer the questions at the end of each task in 2-3 sentences.

## Grading

The final grade is composed from five components. Their max contributions add up to **139%** but the grade is **capped at 100%** — meaning multiple paths to A exist, no single path is required, and no point ever goes to waste.

| Component | Raw Points | Weight | What it rewards |
|-----------|-----------:|-------:|-----------------|
| **Main labs 1-10** (Task 1 + Task 2 + Task 3-where-applicable) | 100 | **70%** | Diligent project work — the floor for any serious student |
| **Bonus tasks 1-10** (2 pts each, flat — no difficulty weighting) | 20 | **14%** | Going above and beyond on weekly topics |
| **Quiz leaderboards** (5 rolling per-2-labs leaderboards, top-10 share 1% pool each) | — | **up to 5%** | Engagement + excellence; rewards late-joining students too |
| **Bonus labs 11 + 12** (Task 1 + Task 2 + Bonus = 10 pts each) | 20 | **20%** | Mastering advanced microservice + K8s resilience patterns |
| **Final exam** | — | **30%** | Optional path — written, comprehensive |
| **Sum (capped at 100%)** | | **139%** | |

### What this produces in practice

Two real paths to A (≥90%):

- **Practice path:** all main labs + bonuses + at least one bonus lab → ≥90%. No exam required.
- **Exam path:** all main labs + bonuses + decent exam → ≥90%. No bonus labs required.
- Doing **both** caps at 100% with a comfortable buffer for missed points elsewhere.

Sample scores:

| Profile | Main | L-bonus | Bonus labs | Exam | Quiz | Total |
|---------|-----:|--------:|-----------:|-----:|-----:|------:|
| All Task 1 only, nothing else | 42% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **42%** |
| All Task 1+2, no bonuses, no exam | 70% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **70%** |
| Add all weekly bonuses | 70% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **84%** |
| + good quiz | 70% | 14% | 0% | 0% | 5% | **89%** ← *just short of A* |
| + finish one bonus lab | 70% | 14% | 10% | 0% | 5% | **99%** ← *A territory* |
| + both bonus labs | 70% | 14% | 20% | 0% | 5% | **100%** (capped) |
| Or take the exam instead | 70% | 14% | 0% | 25% | 5% | **100%** (capped) |
| Coast (Task 1 only + lucky quiz)  | 42% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 5% | **47%** |

**The deliberate design:** `Main + lab-bonuses + quiz` alone tops out at **89% → just short of A**. To earn A you must do at least one bonus lab OR the exam. That stops the "easy A from quiz padding" pattern.

### Quiz leaderboards (the 5%)

Five rolling windows, one per pair of labs:

| Window | Labs covered |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | labs 1-2 |
| 2 | labs 3-4 |
| 3 | labs 5-6 |
| 4 | labs 7-8 |
| 5 | labs 9-10 |

Each window allocates a **1% pool** to its top 10 students. Rough split: #1 = 0.30%, #2 = 0.20%, #3-5 = 0.10% each, #6-10 = 0.04% each. Maxing all 5 leaderboards at #1 = 1.5% — practically capped around 1-2% for top performers, who are unlikely to win every window. Late-joining students can still rank in later windows without being structurally disadvantaged.

### Performance tiers

| Grade | Range | Required to reach |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **A** | 90-100 | All main labs + at least one of: bonus labs / exam (multiple paths) |
| **B** | 75-89 | Main labs + most bonuses, no extension work |
| **C** | 60-74 | Main lab Task 1 across most labs |
| **D** | 0-59 | Below expectations |

### Late submissions

Max 6/12 per lab if submitted within 1 week of deadline. No credit after 1 week.

## Course Completion

By Week 10 you'll have:

- A working QuickTicket deployment on k3d with 5 replicas of the gateway, Postgres on a PVC, ArgoCD-driven GitOps, Argo Rollouts canary with automated analysis, in-cluster Prometheus, and an SLO-based alerting config.
- Lab reports documenting: failure exploration, SLO definition, CI/CD setup, an incident response with postmortem, 3 chaos experiments, a backup/restore cycle with measured RTO/RPO, Locust load tests identifying the system's breaking point, and a capstone reliability review.
- If you did the bonus labs: a 4th microservice with in-code retries + circuit breaker + rate limiter, and a production-grade K8s resilience story (PDBs, graceful shutdown, zero-downtime migrations).

**This is exactly the portfolio you'd walk through in an SRE interview** — see the 5-minute walkthrough script in `submissions/lab10.md` (produced in Lab 10 capstone).
